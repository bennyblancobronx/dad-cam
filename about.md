Dad Cam App — TL;DR

Dad Cam is a cross-platform desktop app for importing, organizing, viewing, and auto-editing footage from old-school digital cameras.
It works for both professionals (rental / production) and personal users.

At its core, Dad Cam is:

A modern video library + memory machine for dad cam footage.

You can:

Drop in years of footage

Browse and watch it like a personal archive

Let the app automatically find the best moments

Generate nostalgic long-form “VHS-style” edits

Not a full video editor.
It’s a video viewer + clipper + auto-editor.

Core Loop

Ingest → Index → Preview → Pick Best → Auto-Edit → Export

1. Import Footage

From USB / SD / HDD / existing folders

Copy into library (default) or reference in place

Fast dedup + verification using BLAKE3 hashing

Resumable, crash-safe ingest

2. Index & Analyze

ffprobe + ExifTool for metadata

Camera detection via profile database

Scene + audio + motion heuristics

3. Generate Previews

Create proxy videos (H.264 720p) for smooth playback

Create thumbnails + sprite sheets for instant hover scrubbing

4. Organize & Watch

All Clips (your personal archive)

Favorites (user picks)

Bad (user rejects)

Best Clips (auto-scored)

You can just open the app and watch your life like a video library.

5. Auto-Edit (VHS Mode)

Generate long-form nostalgic edits:

By Date

By Event

By Favorites

All Clips

With:

Smart audio smoothing

Simple transitions

Optional date/text overlays

6. Export

Share clips for social

Full VHS-style film

Originals always preserved

What It Is (and Isn’t)
It IS:

A modern video viewer for dad cams

A personal memory archive

A clip selector + nostalgia generator

A pro ingestion tool with a consumer UX

It is NOT:

Final Cut / Premiere / Resolve

A full manual timeline editor

One-Line Product Definition

Dad Cam is a cross-platform video library for dad cam footage that lets you watch your life, automatically find the best moments, and generate nostalgic VHS-style films.

That framing is powerful because it positions Dad Cam as:

Photos app for video memories + automatic home movie generator.

Not software.
Not workflow.
Not tech.

A memory device.
