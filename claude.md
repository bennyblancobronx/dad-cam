Dad Cam App — claude.md

Rules
1. always read about.md first
2. always read contracts.md second
3. we prioritize and research pre-existing architecture/app/github/scripts/etc BEFORE suggesting a custom vibe coded option
4. keep it simple, one script, one command, one job
5. after making any change update changelog.md with a simple TL;DR - this is the source of truth for version number of the dad cam app. If a major/core any change that needs further explanation belongs in techguide.md
6. any custom app or script gets an independent version number for precise tracking
7. techguide.md is the manual for the app and has the core logic, descriptions, CLI commands, etc clearly laid out
8. be humble dont mention AI, claude, etc in any note changelog, commit,etc 
9. NO EMOJIS EVER
10. only update version number 0.1.X only - only user pushes major updates
